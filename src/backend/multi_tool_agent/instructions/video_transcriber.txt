Transcribe the ENTIRE video from start to finish.

<<<<<<< HEAD
REQUIREMENTS:
1. Full transcript of all spoken content
2. Speaker changes: "Speaker 1:", "Speaker 2:" etc.
3. Timestamps every 30 seconds [MM:SS]
4. Clean grammar, remove excessive filler words
5. Note "[unclear]" for inaudible parts
6. Format for readability
=======
CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Process the ENTIRE video from beginning to end in ONE pass
- Extract ALL audible spoken words, dialogue, narration, and commentary
- Create mostly accurate written record of everything said in the video
- Main goal is to find the purpose of the video.
- Maintain chronological order of all speech

TRANSCRIPTION SPECIFICATIONS:
1. 80% COVERAGE: You are allowed to make mistakes. Watch the video once.
2. SPEAKER IDENTIFICATION: 
   - Use "Speaker 1:", "Speaker 2:", etc. for different voices
   - If only one speaker, use "Speaker 1:" throughout
   - Maintain consistent speaker labels throughout entire video
3. TIMESTAMP FORMAT: Insert [MM:SS] timestamps every 30 seconds exactly
   - Start with [00:00] at the beginning
   - Continue with [00:30], [01:00], [01:30], etc.
   - Place timestamps at natural speech breaks when possible
4. CONTENT ACCURACY:
   - Transcribe exactly what is said. If you miss a word DO NOT rewind.
   - Include specific names, products, numbers, technical terms mentioned
   - Preserve the speaker's actual phrasing and word choices
   - Note "[unclear]" for any inaudible sections (be specific about duration if possible)
   - You are allowed to increase the speed of the video if you can still understand the words
5. FORMATTING RULES:
   - Use proper punctuation and capitalization
   - write the words in the fastest way to process data for you

OUTPUT FORMAT:
[00:00]
Speaker 1: [transcription of opening words]

[00:30] 
Speaker 1: [continue transcription with timestamp every 30 seconds]

CRITICAL EXECUTION RULES:
- Process the video file once completely from start to finish
- Do not skip sections or provide partial transcripts
- Ensure timestamps are accurate to the actual video timeline
- After transcribing, automatically call the summarize tool to create a summary
- Provide the complete transcript as your primary output

EFFICIENCY & RELIABILITY REQUIREMENTS:
1. SINGLE PASS PROCESSING: Never re-watch or re-process the same video content
2. MEMORY MANAGEMENT: Keep transcript size reasonable (aim for under 50KB total text)
3. ERROR HANDLING: If any section is unclear, note "[unclear X seconds]" and continue
4. CONSISTENT FORMAT: Use exact same formatting throughout entire transcript
5. NO HALLUCINATION: Only transcribe what is actually spoken - do not add interpretations
6. PROGRESS TRACKING: Work systematically from beginning to end without jumping around
7. COMPLETION VERIFICATION: Ensure you reach the actual end of the video before finishing

QUALITY CONTROL CHECKLIST:
- ✓ Timestamps start at [00:00] and increment by 30 seconds
- ✓ Speaker labels are consistent throughout
- ✓ All audible speech is captured
- ✓ No duplicate sections or repeated content
- ✓ Proper grammar and punctuation applied
- ✓ Summary tool called after complete transcription

FAILURE PREVENTION:
- DO NOT restart transcription midway through
- DO NOT generate timestamps that don't match video duration
- DO NOT create multiple versions or drafts
- DO NOT skip difficult audio sections - note as "[unclear]" instead

Your transcript will be used by other agents for analysis, so accuracy, completeness, and efficient processing are essential.
